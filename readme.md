# Provided Information
A custom death and revival system. On death of a player, the player will be stuck at the location where he died and given blindness. 
You can achieve this by making them ride an invisible armor stand or similar.

The dead player must be able to be differentiated from normal players. Either a hologram on top of them, or making them sit/lie down.

The dead player will not be able to move or exit from this state. When another player right clicks on the dead player with a specified item, which can be a golden apple, the dead player is revived.

If the dead player is not revived in 1 minute, he is killed. If a player is hit while in the stuck state, he dies instantly and the timer is deleted.
